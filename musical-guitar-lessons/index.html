        <h2 class="product-offering">Beginner</h2>
        <p>We offer beginner lessons for students who are just starting to learn guitar. No experience is required for this level of lesson. We will start with the basics of learning the elements of the guitar. Then we will move to learning three string chords. Finally, we advance to our first four full chords!</p>

        <h2 class="product-offering">Intermediate</h2>
        <p>Our intermediate level lessons are for students with at least a year of experience. Students should know the G, C, Em, and D chords and be able to strum consistently and on tempo. This curriculum will expand the student's knowledge of chord shapes and familiarity with the fretboard. We will focus on improvisation, pentatonic scales, and more intermediate level chords.</p>

        <h2 class="product-offering">Advanced</h2>
        <p>Advanced lessons are for students with over two years of guitar experience. Students should be able to play all of the open chord shapes in major and minor. They should know the major, minor, and pentatonic scales and be able to play them in multiple keys. The advanced lesson curriculum introduces barre chords, tablature reading, and increasingly more complex improvisational skills.</p>

        <h2 class="product-offering">Ukulele</h2>
        <p><strong>New this year!</strong> We have expanded our lesson offerings to include ukulele instruction. With four strings instead of six, the ukulele can be a great "gateway" instrument to learn the guitar. It is also a ton of fun to learn on its own! Ukulele offers a lower barrier of entry than guitar and can be a great starting point, especially for the youngest learners.</p>
